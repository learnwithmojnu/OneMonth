## DOM
- Document Object Model: A page we visit called document. A document is like a tree, all tag in html document are Object. The document has `<html>, <body>, <div>, <h1>`. All tags are called Object. If we want access `<body>` tag: `document.body`. If we access h1 tag which is the parent child of the body, we use `document.body.h1`. We access document object in many ways - `querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementById` etc.

## querySelector("h1")
